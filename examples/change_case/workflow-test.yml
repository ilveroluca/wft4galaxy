# galaxy_url -> URL of the Galaxy instance to be used.
#               If unspecified, wft4galaxy will check the GALAXY_URL environment variable
#               You can also specify the URL on the command line

# The base_path is the directory with respect to which all other paths are evaluated.
# The default value is the directory that contains this file.

##########################################################################################
workflows:
  # This is the "workflows" test suite.
  # You can define multiple tests in this suite
  # 
  # We define a test case called "change_case"
  change_case:
    # 'file' is the path to file defining the workflow to be tested.
    #  You can generate this file by exporting the workflow from Galaxy
    file: "workflow.ga"
    # The input datasets for the workflow.  Specify them under "inputs:"
    inputs:
      # The lines consist of <input id>: <filename>; the id is the *Name* field of the input
      # box defined in the workflow.
      InputText: "input"
      ### You can also explicitly specify dataset type using an extended syntax ###
      # <input id>:              <-- the *Name* field of the input box defined in the workflow
      #   file: <filename>       <-- the filename of the input dataset
      #   type: <dataset type>   <-- the file format of the input dataset as specified by Galaxy (e.g., 'txt')
    expected:
      # Under 'expected' we have the workflow's expected output datasets
      #   Format -> Id: filename
      # Get the output id from the output dataset's *Label* field as specified in the workflow
      OutputText: "expected_output"
      ### Using a custom comparator function: use the extended syntax ###
      # OutputText:  <- this is the output Label
      #     file: "expected_output.txt"  <- path to file containing expected output
      #     comparator: "filecmp.cmp"    <- comparator function to use


# There is a more extensive explanation on how to get input and output ids here:
